This project looks at how teenagers use their phones and how it affects their well-being. Today, phones are part of everyday life, and teens spend a lot of time on them for things like social media, gaming, studying, and staying in touch with friends and family. While phones can be helpful, too much use may harm academic performance, mental health, and overall balance in life.

The project analyzes teen phone usage data to find patterns between hours of use, purposes of use, and levels of addiction, anxiety, depression, and school performance. By using statistics and graphs, it shows differences across groups such as gender and grade level.

The goal is to better understand how phone use impacts teens both in school and emotionally, so parents, teachers, and others can help encourage healthier and more balanced phone habits.
