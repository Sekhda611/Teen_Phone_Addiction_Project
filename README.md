Teen Smartphone Usage and Addiction Impact Dataset link [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumedh1507/teen-phone-addiction.
The dataset I selected contains detailed information about teenagersâ€™ phone usage, including time spent on different activities (social media, gaming, education), daily usage hours, sleep patterns, academic performance, and mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. It also includes demographic details like age, gender, and school grade, along with lifestyle factors such as exercise hours, family communication, and parental control.

This project looks at how teenagers use their phones and how it affects their well-being. Today, phones are part of everyday life, and teens spend a lot of time on them for things like social media, gaming, studying, and staying in touch with friends and family. While phones can be helpful, too much use may harm academic performance, mental health, and overall balance in life. 

The project analyzes teen phone usage data to find patterns between hours of use, purposes of use, and levels of addiction, anxiety, depression, and school performance. By using statistics and graphs, it shows differences across groups such as gender and grade level.

The goal is to better understand how phone use impacts teens both in school and emotionally. By analyzing the relationships between phone use and key outcomes, I aim to identify which behaviors are most strongly linked to higher addiction risk. I want to explore how excessive phone usage affects academic performance, sleep quality, and mental health.
